**How I approached the problem statement:**

```
The first step was to understand the problem statement. The overall idea was to create something on the clone of twitter, where I had to create a profile for an user, they should able to tweet and and follow user who are in twitter and they can also search users based on the name finally they also able to see the tweets of the their following people.

I decided to build a Schema to understand and fix the data models involved and also limit the number of revisits to this area, as from previous experiences, its a good idea to freeze schema early on.

First of all, I decided to build a Authentication. So, I planned how to do it and wrote some APIs and MySql Queries.
```

**Features**:

* THe user can SignUp and Login from LandingPage.

* After successfull login user will go to Home page.

* The person can edit their profile details whenever they need after the successful authentication.

* User can able to tweet in their dashboard and they can also see their tweet on dashboard.

* Users can able to see whom they are following and who are their followers.

* They can see the tweets[whom they follow] in the feed.

* The user can also post what is happening in their surrounding.

* The user can search the particular user by Name.

* The user can see total number of users.
